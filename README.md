p2-icons
========
This set of icons was created based on badges of various animals that I designed.  I took the basic designs from my original
designs and simplified them down to work as icons.  I used Fontastic to product the fontkit.  It was fairly easy to use 
once I started going.  The only real challenge I faced was figuring out that they had included a prepackaged file for me to 
put up my font.  This was a pretty straight forward process and something I enjoyed doing.
